## Challenges ##
- Competition on content negatively impacts our exposure and marketing efforts.
- High licensing fees from various platforms obstruct our expansion.
- Relying on exclusive shows and IPs may not be an effective strategy for building our own streaming service.


## Solutions ##
- Implement an upgraded conversion channel system that consolidates a user’s subscribed streaming services. This system would display and link to each service within a single app, enhancing user convenience.
- Our streaming service app could directly redirect users to each platform’s website to watch exclusive videos. This approach would reduce the need for multiple app downloads, thereby freeing up device space.


## Evaluation ##
- Deeply understand the needs and behaviors of our target audience, fostering effective teamwork and communication.
- Deliver on schedule, meeting project timelines consistently.
- Manage resources effectively, adhering strictly to the budget.
- Maintain excellent quality standards across all aspects of the project.
- Provide applications that meet or exceed customer expectations.
- Proactively resolve user concerns or issues, and continuously improve the app experience.
